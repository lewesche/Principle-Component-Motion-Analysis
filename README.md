# Principle-Component-Motion-Analysis
A motion tracking algorithm along with singular value decomposition was used to determine the principle components of a simple oscilating system, a mass (paint can) on a spring. The oscillating mass was recorded from a series of camera angles and tracked throughout the reference frame of each camera. 
#
The effects of noise, off axis movement, and rotation were evaluated by recording a series of tests. In the first test the paint can was recorded with steady footage oscillating close to straight up and down. In the second test noise was added. In the third test the mass was released off center so that it oscillated in both the vertical direction along the spring and the transverse direction. In the fourth test the mass was released off center and spun to induce rotation. 
#
The mass coordinates of the mass in each reference frame and test were combined into a singular data set, and Principle component analysis was used to reconstruct the motion of each test in three dimensions.
